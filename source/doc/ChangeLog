    * [brian] Added Unistd.h as an interface so we can use its constants in
              Runtime
    * [brian] -o lessconstants option to compiler to emit all constants as
              an addition of a field value and a small constant. This
              prevents the classfile constant pool from overflowing on large
              applications. This has a small performance impact. 
    * [brian] Added stubs for the rmdir syscall and a minimal implementation
              of sysconf
    * [brian] Emit data segments as a series of <32k strings to avoid
              hitting classfile limits
January 10, 2003
    * [brian] The compiler now outputs data segments as Strings rather than
              huge int arrays.
    * [brian] Cleaned up Makefile and upstream/Makefile to separate the 
              required mips2java stuff from the tests. Ideally the tests
              should be completelly separate from the main makefile but
              keeping them integrated allows for better dependency checking
              and faster builds.

    * Much thanks goes to Mohan Embar for discovering and fixing most
      of the issues below.
    * [brian] Updated Makefile to allow bulding with gcj
              (make JAVAC="gcj -C" JAVA="gij")
    * [brian] Updated Runtime.java to silently ignore SecurityExceptions
              thrown from System.getProperty()
    * [brian] Compiler now uses a PrintWriter for output rather than
              PrintStream and properly closes the file on exit
    * [brian] Made the htojava script a bourne shell script rather than a
              perl script to remove the dependency on perl.
December 29, 2003
    * [brian] Changed build process to use -ffunction-sections, 
              -fdata-sections, and --gc-sections
    * [brian] Update support.s to use function sections
    * [brian] Make the interpreter report the pc/sourceline of 
              exceptions.
    * [brian] Remove stdio calls from FreeTypeHelper
    * [brian] Added gcc patch to fix -fdata-sections bug
    * [brian] Added freetype patch to avoid stdio
December 2, 2003
    * [brian] Cleaned up a bunch of //FEATUREs and //FIXMEs. No major
              changes, just cleanup.
November 30, 2003
    * [brian] Added crude support for O_APPEND and O_TRUNC

November 29, 2003
    * [brian] Moved all sources under org/xwt/mips - modified Makefiles
              accordingly.
    * [brian] Added org.xwt.mips.util tree containing SeekableData, 
              SeekableByteArray, SeekableFile, and SeekableInputStream. 
    * [brian] Made ELF.java use SeekableData rather than RandomAccessFile
    * [brian] Made Runtime.java use org.xwt.mips.util.Seekable* for most
              file operations.
    * [brian] Added construtors to Interpreter.java that accept an InputStream
              or SeekableData.
    * [brian] Added support for the /dev/fd/n namespace and /dev/{null,zero}
    * [brian] Added test/FDTest.java example and updated tests/Test.c
    * [brian] Fixed absolute pathame bug on Win32
